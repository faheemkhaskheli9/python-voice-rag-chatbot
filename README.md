## 1. Problem

A lightweight, beginner-friendly voice chatbot that demonstrates the full STT -> RAG -> LLM -> TTS loop without the complexity of a real-time streaming stack.

## 2. Architecture

```text
Microphone -> Speech Recognition -> RAG -> LLM -> TTS -> Speaker Output
```

## 3. Technology Stack

- Python
- SpeechRecognition library
- LangChain
- OpenAI API
- pyttsx3 or gTTS

## 4. Feature List

- Microphone input capture
- Speech recognition
- RAG-based retrieval
- LLM response generation
- Text-to-speech output

## 5. Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Basic mic-to-text and text-to-speech loop
2. Phase 2: RAG integration for knowledge-grounded answers
3. Phase 3: Polish and packaging as a simple desktop demo

## 7. Setup

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd python-voice-rag-chatbot
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # or: pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env              # fill in API keys / config
```

## 8. Dataset

Document which public dataset(s) or synthetic data generators are used here.
No proprietary, employer-owned, or client-identifiable data is used in this project.

## 9. Training / Execution

Document the commands used to run training, ingestion, or the main pipeline, e.g.:

```bash
python -m src.main --config configs/default.yaml
```

## 10. Evaluation

Document evaluation metrics and how to reproduce them here (see `docs/evaluation.md`).

## 11. Results

_To be filled in as the implementation progresses — screenshots, metrics tables, and
sample outputs go here._

## 12. API

_If this project exposes an API, document the main endpoints here (or link to
auto-generated OpenAPI docs, e.g. `/docs` for FastAPI)._

## 13. Docker

```bash
docker build -t python-voice-rag-chatbot .
docker run -p 8000:8000 python-voice-rag-chatbot
```

## 14. Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 15. Limitations

- This is a from-scratch, independent recreation built for portfolio purposes.
- Performance numbers, once added, are based on public datasets and are not
  representative of any production system's real-world results.

## 16. Future Work

- Expand evaluation coverage and add CI-based regression checks.
- Add more configuration presets and deployment targets.
- Track open items as GitHub Issues.

## 17. Disclosure

This repository is an **independent open-source recreation inspired by the kind of
production systems I have worked on professionally**. It contains no employer or
client source code, prompts, datasets, credentials, architecture diagrams, or
business logic. All code, data, and documentation here are original or built on
publicly available datasets and open-source tools.
